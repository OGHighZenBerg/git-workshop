# GitHub Workflow Automation Blueprint

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical blueprint for automating the GitHub workflow for this project. The goal is to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically lints, tests, and deploys the application.

## 2. Design

The workflow will be triggered on every push to the `main` branch and on every pull request targeting the `main` branch. The workflow will consist of the following jobs:

*   **Lint:** This job will run a linter to check the code for style and formatting errors.
*   **Test:** This job will run the test suite to ensure that the code is working correctly.
*   **Build:** This job will build the application and create a production-ready artifact.
*   **Deploy:** This job will deploy the application to a staging environment for manual testing.

## 3. Technologies

The following technologies will be used to implement the workflow:

*   **GitHub Actions:** This will be used to define and run the workflow.
*   **ESLint:** This will be used to lint the JavaScript code.
*   **Node.js:** This will be used to run the tests and build the application.

## 4. Implementation

The workflow will be defined in a YAML file located in the `.github/workflows` directory. The file will contain the following steps:

1.  **Checkout the code:** This step will check out the code from the repository.
2.  **Install dependencies:** This step will install the dependencies required to run the linter, tests, and build.
3.  **Run the linter:** This step will run the linter and report any errors.
4.  **Run the tests:** This step will run the tests and report any failures.
5.  **Build the application:** This step will build the application and create a production-ready artifact.
6.  **Deploy to staging:** This step will deploy the application to a staging environment.

## 5. Future Work

*   Add a job to deploy the application to production.
*   Add a job to automatically generate release notes.
*   Add a job to publish the application to a package registry.

## 6. GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages will be used to host the project's documentation. A new workflow will be created to automatically build and deploy the documentation to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 7. GitHub Code Scanning

GitHub Code Scanning will be enabled to automatically scan the code for security vulnerabilities. The results of the scan will be available in the "Security" tab of the repository.

## 8. Copilot

Copilot will be used to provide AI-powered code completion and suggestions. Copilot will be enabled for all developers working on the project.
