# Module 7: Introduction to GitHub

## What is GitHub?

While Git is a command-line tool for version control, **GitHub** is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a place to store your code online and offers a suite of tools for collaboration and project management.

Think of it this way:
- **Git** is the tool you use to track changes and manage versions on your local machine.
- **GitHub** is the platform you use to share your Git repositories with others and work together.

## Key Features of GitHub

- **Remote Repository Hosting:** A central place to store your project that can be accessed from anywhere.
- **Collaboration:** Tools like Pull Requests allow for structured code reviews and discussions before changes are merged.
- **Issue Tracking:** A system for tracking tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.
- **Project Management:** Kanban-style boards to organize and prioritize your work.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automation tools to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.
- **Social Coding:** Follow other developers, star projects you find interesting, and discover new open-source software.

## Creating a Repository on GitHub

1.  Log in to your GitHub account.
2.  In the upper-right corner of any page, click the `+` icon, and then click **New repository**.
3.  Give your repository a short, memorable name.
4.  (Optional) Add a description for your repository.
5.  Choose a repository visibility. **Public** repositories are visible to everyone, while **Private** repositories are only accessible to you and people you share them with.
6.  (Optional) You can choose to initialize the repository with a `README` file, a `.gitignore` file (to ignore certain files from being tracked), and a license.
7.  Click **Create repository**.

That's it! You now have a home for your code on the internet.
