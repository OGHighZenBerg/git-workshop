# Module 1: Introduction to Version Control

## What is Version Control?

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps you track changes to files over time. Think of it like an unlimited "undo" button for your entire project. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, and more.

## Why is it Important?

- **Collaboration:** It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. The VCS merges the changes together.
- **History:** You have a complete history of who changed what, when, and why. This is invaluable for debugging and understanding the project's evolution.
- **Branching:** You can create independent branches to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main, stable version of your project.
- **Safety Net:** If you make a mistake, you can easily roll back to a previous, working version.

## What is Git?

Git is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**. This is a key difference from older, centralized systems.

- **Centralized (e.g., SVN):** There is a single central server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
- **Distributed (e.g., Git):** Every developer has a full copy of the entire project history on their local machine. This means you can work offline, commit changes, and then "sync up" with others when you have a network connection.

Git is the most popular version control system in the world, known for its speed, data integrity, and support for non-linear workflows.
