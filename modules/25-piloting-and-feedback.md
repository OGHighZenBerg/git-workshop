# Module 25: Piloting and Feedback

This document provides guidance on the final, human-centric steps of workshop development: testing it with a live audience and refining the content based on their feedback.

## Piloting the Workshop

Before delivering the workshop to a large audience, it is crucial to run a pilot session with a small, friendly group.

**Goals of the Pilot:**
- **Identify Sticking Points:** Where do participants get confused? Which concepts need more explanation? Which exercises are problematic?
- **Check Pacing:** Is the workshop too fast or too slow? Do you need to cut content or add more detail?
- **Test Technical Setup:** Ensure all exercises work as expected and that any required software installations are straightforward.
- **Gather Initial Feedback:** Get a qualitative sense of how the material is received.

## Collecting Feedback

Use a structured feedback form to gather actionable insights from your participants. This can be a simple Google Form or a printed sheet.

### Sample Feedback Form

**1. What was your overall impression of the workshop?**

## Refining the Content

Treat your workshop materials as a living project. The feedback you receive is invaluable.

1.  **Triage Feedback:** Go through all the feedback you've collected.
2.  **Create Issues:** For each actionable piece of feedback, create a new GitHub Issue in your workshop repository. For example:
    - `[Bug] Exercise 3 for Milestone 2 has a typo`
    - `[Docs] Clarify the explanation of interactive rebase`
    - `[Feature] Add a module on Git tags`
3.  **Prioritize and Work:** Use labels and project boards to prioritize these new issues.
4.  **Iterate:** Work through the issues, improve the content, and deliver an even better workshop next time!
